    <h2>About</h2>
    Medical Clinic is the partnership of Dr Jesica Brown, Dr John Smith and Dr Frank Taylor. They have many years of experience working as GPs in D15, in both single-handed and group practices, dealing with medical card and private patients alike. As a result, they have intimate knowledge of the local population health needs, strong links with local health service providers and they have established themselves as hard working, enthusiastic and trustworthy GPs. In addition to their vocational GP training, each doctor has attained further qualifications in their chosen areas of special interest, providing for a broad synergistic skills-base within the clinic. Over a number of years they have worked closely together and have forged a strong bond based on their mutual shared view of the future of general practice â€“ maintaining the principal values of primary care while embracing modern developments. With this in mind they have developed the Medical Clinic team to enable appointment access continuity care, with choice of male or female doctors, providing an expansive range of services for all age groups.
